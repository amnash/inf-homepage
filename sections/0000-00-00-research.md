My primary interests are semantics and type systems for programming languages, and implementation of programming languages (compilers). In particular, I am interested in how to take advantage of type systems to accelerate and generate efficient, portable programs.

My supervisors are [Sam Lindley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley) (LFCS) and [Christophe Dubach](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdubach) (ICSA).

I have been kicked out of ICSA.
